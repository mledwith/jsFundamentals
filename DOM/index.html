    <title>Intro to DOM Manipulation</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- 
        DOM stands for Document Object Model, and is what allows our JS to interact with the HTML and CSS of our page. The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browsers window.

        DOM is an object representation of a web page, which can be modified with a scripting language like JavaScript.

        Two primary functions:
        1. Making a model of an HTML page
            - when the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory
            - the DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree.The DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree is made of objects.

        2. Accessing and changing the HTML page
            - the DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.

        Usually when working with the DOM tree, we will access an element we want to work with, and then we will modify, or manipulate it.

        ACCESSING:
            COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING A SINGLE ELEMENT:
            - getElementbyID()
            - querySelector()

            COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS:
            - querySelectorAll()
            - getElementbyClassName()
            - getElementByTagName()

        MANIPULATING:
            COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITh HTML CONTENT:
            - innerHTML
            - textContent
            - createElement

        COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH TAG ATTRIBUTES:
            - className / id
            - setAttribute()
            - getAttribute()

    <!-- ! 1 -->
    <p id = "testParagraph" >Sample Text</p>

    <!-- ! 2 -->
    <!-- p.sampleClass*4: emmet abbreviation -->
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <h2 class="sampleClass">An h2 example</h2>
    <hr>

    <span id="spanTest">Hello <span style="display: none">World</span></span>
    <br>
    <hr>
    

    <!-- ! 3 -->
    <button id="clickThis">Click!</button>
    <br />
    <hr />


    <!-- ! 4 -->
    <label for = "nameInput">Enter your name:</label> <br />
    <input type="text" id="nameInput" placeholder="Your Name Here" />

    <!-- 
        We can write javascript directly in our html page by typing it within a <script> tag, similiar to how we would write css in a <style> tag
     -->
    <script>
        //now we can write some javascript
        // console.log('Hello from the script tag~!');
    </script> 
    <!-- 

     <!-- 
    What if we want to use an external javascript file in this webpage?
    -->

    <script src='script.js'></script>
